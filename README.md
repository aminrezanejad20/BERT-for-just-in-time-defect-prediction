# BERT-for-just-in-time-defect-prediction

This project demonstrates how to train a BERT model on the QT dataset. The QT dataset, developed by the Qt Company (https://www.qt.io/), is a cross-platform application framework that allows contributions from individual developers and organizations. This repository provides an implementation for training and evaluating a BERT model on the QT dataset. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model for natural language processing tasks.
